# Burger-Logger-WK3
Using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Following the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.
<br><br>

This a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.<br>
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.<br>
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
<br>The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
